#  Netflix Titles – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project presents an **in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to understand the platform’s **content composition, growth patterns, and strategic direction**.  
The analysis focuses on metadata such as content type, release year, ratings, genres, countries, and textual descriptions to derive meaningful insights.

This project demonstrates strong skills in **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and basic natural language processing (NLP)** using Python.

## Key Findings & Insights

### Content Strategy
- Netflix’s library is **movie-heavy (~70%)**, indicating a strong focus on feature-length content.
- The platform experienced **aggressive content expansion between 2016 and 2019**.
- Netflix follows a **dual strategy**:
  - Investing in **brand-new originals** added in the same year as release
  - Maintaining a **deep catalog of licensed older content**

---

###  Global Dominance
- While the **United States** remains the largest content producer, Netflix’s catalog is **highly international**.
- **India** is a major contributor, reflected in:
  - Popular genres such as **International Movies**
  - Frequently appearing actors from regional industries

### Target Audience
- The content library is clearly skewed toward **mature audiences**.
- **TV-MA and TV-14** are the most common content ratings, highlighting Netflix’s focus on adult and teen viewers.

---

### Content Format & Genre
- **Dramas and Comedies** dominate across both Movies and TV Shows.
- Most movies have a **runtime between 90–120 minutes**, aligning with industry standards.
- The majority of TV shows have **only one season**, suggesting a **high-risk, high-reward strategy** where Netflix tests concepts quickly before committing to long-term production.

---

### Common Themes (Text Analysis)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) on content descriptions reveals recurring themes such as:
  - Life and personal growth
  - Family and relationships
  - Love, discovery, and human connections

---

### Limitations
- This dataset represents a **snapshot in time** and does **not include viewership or engagement metrics**.
- As a result, the analysis focuses on the **supply of content**, not its demand or popularity.
- Despite this limitation, the EDA provides a **strong, multi-faceted understanding** of the evolution and composition of Netflix’s content library.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Trend Analysis, NLP (Bigrams)
